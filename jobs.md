# 17b: course web infrastructure

Behind every successful course is a solid infrascructure.

This short-term job entails setting up web infrastructure for upcoming Spring-term courses, including course websites, Slack, and other tools.

Responsibilities:
- Extending previous course website setups (like [4241](https://cs4241-17a.github.io/), to different courses.
    - Developing and iterating on schedules.
    - Designing better experiences for students.
- Establishing other elements of course infrastructure: Slack, Basecamp, etcetera.
- Evaluating and testing alternate infrastructures, like [InstructAssist](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cshue/instructassist.html)

Requirements:

- A working knowledge of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
    - (note: you can pick jekyll up in a weekend. it's basically a ruby program that converts markdown documents to HTML)
- Proficiency in git + GitHub
    - i.e. you know how to commit individual files, and how to use `.gitignore`

Details:
- We're currently targeting an immediate start in December, and continuing until the start of C-term.
- There is a possibility to continue into C-term.
